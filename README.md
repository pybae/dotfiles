dotfiles
========

My dotfiles for a variety of programs including.
* Zsh
* Vim
* Tmux
* Git

My configuration for emacs is [here](https://github.com/pybae/emacs)

My dotfiles are managed through [RCM](http://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/rcm.7.html) <br/>
*Quick Install* <br/>
Install [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) <br/>

Clone the repo:

```
And you're done! You can check if the installation succeeded by running "lsrc"

Otherwise, you can manually copy the files
